26 @@@ 0.0 @@@ LOS ANGELES, California (Reuters) -- "To insure or not to insure?"
26 @@@ 3.0 @@@ It isn't Shakespeare, but it is the dramatic question Hollywood filmmakers are asking about Lindsay Lohan following her legal troubles this week.
26 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Lindsay Lohan may still get work after her legal problems are settled, but the cost will be high.
26 @@@ 2.0 @@@ It is an important question, too, because whether companies insure Lohan's future movies may determine whether she will quickly fall off Hollywood's A-list.
26 @@@ 0.0 @@@ But Lohan fans have little to fear because no actor is uninsurable, say underwriting experts.
26 @@@ 0.0 @@@ While some producers may balk at conditions for hiring problematic stars, experts say that unless an actor is serving time in prison, even the most volatile can be covered -- albeit at a high cost. "
26 @@@ 3.0 @@@ For a price, anything can be done, although an insurance carrier can make things so unpalatable that at times the makers of the film just won't be interested," said Ross Miller, partner with insurance brokerage D.R. Reiff & Associates Inc. Lohan's arrest this week in Los Angeles on suspicion of drunken driving and cocaine possession has left Hollywood wondering if the actress, who shot to fame as a child in Disney films like "The Parent Trap," is too risky to cast in a film.
26 @@@ 2.0 @@@ Timeline: Lindsay Lohan's troubles » It remains to be seen whether her latest relapse and brush with the law will cost her a role in "Poor Things," a film produced by and starring Oscar-winner Shirley MacLaine.

26 @@@ 2.0 @@@ Last July, a producer on Lohan's last film, "Georgia Rule," scolded her publicly for repeatedly showing up late on the set, costing the movie's makers hundreds of thousands of dollars.
26 @@@ 2.0 @@@ Brian Kingman, a managing director with entertainment insurance broker Aon/Albert G. Ruben said covering situations like Lohan's required a lot of calculation and risk management.
26 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Insurance rates for errant actors can range anywhere from 1 percent to 3 percent of a movie's production budget, which can range from $5 million to $100 million or more, he said. "

404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ And you know, more or less, how much you want to spend -- or how much you can afford.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ You've kicked tires, talked to salesmen, taken a few shiny new numbers for a test-drive and you're ready to make the deal.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ If you eat in your car you may want to consider fabric or leather protections.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Except, you're not quite done.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ You still need to decide whether to buy any of those "extras" that your salesperson will always suggest.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Some of these extras have real value and are probably worth adding.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Others ... maybe not so much.
404 @@@ 1.0 @@@ The list of "extras" offered by most dealers, may include paint sealant, fabric protection/leather care, extended warranties, extended 'one price' service contracts, rust/underbody coatings and anti-theft systems, to mention a few.
404 @@@ 1.0 @@@ We wanted to know which of these new car extras were worth it and which ones a consumer can do without.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ To get to the bottom of it, we thought we would consult an expert -- David Bennett, Manager of Automotive Programs for AAA.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ As it turns out, like most things in life, the answer often just comes down to what's best for you, depending on your own situation, budget or locale.
404 @@@ 4.0 @@@ Let's address these add-ons one by one: Paint sealant "I think that most paint jobs on cars are pretty good these days, so in most cases you probably don't need that anymore," said Bennett, who offered one caveat. "
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ But that can depend on what part of the country you live in -- what the climate is, whether you get a lot of snow and ice, and what the road crews put down on the road -- whether it is salt, or if it is something that is less harmful to the paint.
404 @@@ 1.0 @@@ But generally, as long as you keep your car washed, and wash that salt off of it, and get it waxed regularly, that paint should last without getting the 'add-on' sealer at the dealership.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Also, if you get a chip or a ding, get it fixed so the rust doesn't get a chance to set in and spread."
404 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Fabric / leather protection These extras are fairly self-explanatory -- the dealer "treats" the upholstered or leather seating with a "protection" product that make the seats more resistant to stains or scuff marks. "
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ This can be a good purchase, but the first question you should ask before buying it is, 'What kind of lifestyle do I lead?'
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ suggests Bennett. "
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Do you have a lot of kids and are they prone to spill things?
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Or is your vehicle mostly going to be occupied by adults?"
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Do you eat in the car with some regularity?
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ If so, and you're just too darn messy for your own good, a stain protection might be a good way to go. "
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Also, look at exclusions in the plan," advises Bennett. "
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ If you're a smoker, and the plan excludes burn holes from cigarette ashes, and you're not diligent about making sure your ash is always short, that might not be a good purchase because of that exclusion.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Each of these policies or plans is probably offering something different, and you need to read all of the exclusions before making that purchase, because it might not be a good one for you."
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ If you want to save some cash, one option would be to forego the protectant and just make sure you clean your seats regularly with a good upholstery cleaner or leather cleaner.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ To remove spots from a leather seat, use a good leather cleaner and work it into the spot with a soft cloth.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ If the spot still remains, let it sit for a few hours.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Repeat, as they say, if necessary.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ It's also a good idea , to use a leather conditioner regularly on leather seats to restore moisture and to maintain its appearance.
404 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Rustproofing This is when the dealership applies various rust-inhibiting chemicals, waxes or sealers to the vehicle's undercarriage.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ It can also be applied to other rust-prone areas.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Rustproofing treatments sometimes include a guarantee over a certain number of years.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Keep in mind that some guarantees require annual "checkups" to re-apply the sealers or rust inhibitors to any areas where the rustproofing may have been damaged. "
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ I don't think this is necessary in most cases," opines Bennett. "
404 @@@ 1.0 @@@ The way most vehicles are constructed today, they are not nearly as prone to underbody rusting as they used to be in the old days -- even in the north, where they get a lot of snow."
404 @@@ 2.0 @@@ LoJack Car Security System / Anti-theft systems: The folks at LoJack Car Security Systems report that a vehicle is stolen every 25 seconds in the U.S. Using a car alarm is one way to protect your vehicle.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ But if you want to go the more high-tech "tracking" route, using a security system like LoJack may give you more peace of mind.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ The LoJack System, includes a small radio frequency transceiver hidden in up to 20 different places in the vehicle.
404 @@@ 1.0 @@@ The System uses a code that is tied into the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).

404 @@@ 2.0 @@@ LoJack claims that over 200,000 vehicles have been recovered worldwide using their system, with over 100,000 of those in the U.S. "Whether or not this is a purchase you should make depends on various factors.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ If you live in a high-crime area, a system like this could provide you with peace of mind," advises Bennett. "
404 @@@ 1.0 @@@ But even if you live in a safe, low-crime district, your car can still be stolen from a busy downtown street or parking garage," he notes.
404 @@@ 2.0 @@@ One caveat: Some car owners may not want their car back after it has been stolen, especially if it has been seriously vandalized, or if it has been driven so hard that it causes some mechanical problems.
404 @@@ 2.0 @@@ Another thing to consider is that owners of GM vehicles that come with its patented OnStar system, probably won't need a theft tracking program, says Bennett. "
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Because the system allows OnStar operators to track the location of the vehicle if it is stolen.
404 @@@ 2.0 @@@ So if you buy a GM car with the OnStar system, you may want to pass on a LoJack or similar tracking system."
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Extended warranties "This really does depend on how long you plan to keep the vehicle, because most of these extended warranty plans don't kick in until the manufacturer's warranty expires," advises Bennett. "
404 @@@ 1.0 @@@ And these days, those manufacturers warranties are three or five years, sometimes longer. "
404 @@@ 1.0 @@@ So if you plan on selling the car after three or five years, it probably doesn't make sense to buy the extended warranty."
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Some warranties offer transferable policies, which let you "sell" the warranty along with the vehicle.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Others allow you to "return" the warranty for a pro-rated refund.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Bennett also explains that not all warranties are created equal. "
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ They usually have three levels of warranties: A basic extended warranty will just cover the powertrain, for example; while a better one will cover the powertrain plus some other components that are listed -- or an 'exclusionary' extended warranty may say it covers everything except those items that are listed.
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ At the top end, the best warranty just covers everything, but that is also the most expensive."
404 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Bennett gives an example of one manufacturers warranty. "
404 @@@ 2.0 @@@ For a 2007 Buick, the basic manufacturers warranty is five years or 100,000 miles for the powertrain coverage, and the corrosion warranty is six years or 100,000 miles.
404 @@@ 1.0 @@@ In fact, that's the same warranty GM offers on their Chevy and Cadillac brands." "
404 @@@ 0.0 @@@ That's a pretty good warranty, so if you plan on only keeping your vehicle for five years or less, the extended warranty is probably money you don't need to spend."

408 @@@ 4.0 @@@ The facts and remedy When the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety studied more than 10,000 incidents of road rage and violent aggressive driving committed in the 1990s, it found that at least 218 people were killed and another 12,610 injured when drivers got angry.
408 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Many of these aggressors are males aged 18 to 26.
408 @@@ 2.0 @@@ The AAA Web site offers a three-step plan to avoid becoming the victim of aggressive driving: • The first tip is "don't offend," which includes cutting off other drivers, driving slowly in the left lane, tailgating and gesturing to other drivers. •
408 @@@ 0.0 @@@ The agency then warns to "not engage," which advises steering clear of trouble, not making eye contact and getting help, by calling 911, in the event of experiencing dangerous, aggressive driving.
408 @@@ 0.0 @@@ It then asks at-risk drivers to "adjust their attitude," which involves "forgetting winning" (for the drivers to whom driving is a Darwinian survival of the fittest), or putting themselves in the other drivers' shoes. •

408 @@@ 1.0 @@@ For example, Florida drivers yell at each other more than in California, where verbal interplay can be interpreted as road rage in a criminal court.

433 @@@ 0.0 @@@ And an attack from the crabgrass.
433 @@@ 0.0 @@@ But you'll face more stealthy opponents, too: root-chomping grubs and microscopic mildew that turn the grass from green to gray or brown. "
433 @@@ 0.0 @@@ If a lawn is neglected, or cared for in a hit-or-miss way, it gets weak," says This Old House landscape contractor Roger Cook. "
433 @@@ 0.0 @@@ And that's when weeds, insects, or fungal diseases become a major problem."
433 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Little wonder that last year almost 50 million homeowners bought products to fight these invaders.
433 @@@ 0.0 @@@ But as in most battles, the best defense is a strong offense: doing everything right to cultivate healthy turf.
433 @@@ 0.0 @@@ That means giving it up to an inch and a half of water per week; aerating and dethatching annually so water and nutrients can get down to the roots; mowing with a sharp blade to the right height (ask your local garden center what's best where you live); and fertilizing in spring and fall.
433 @@@ 0.0 @@@ So promise yourself -- and your turf -- you'll do that this year.

433 @@@ 0.0 @@@ This Old House: What type of grass is right for your yard Culprits: Crabgrass or broadleaf weeds such as dandelion, purslane, henbit, and chickweed that commonly pop up where soil is compacted and grass hasn't completely taken root.
433 @@@ 0.0 @@@ To check for compacted soil, stick a screwdriver into the ground; it should slide in easily.
433 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Solutions: The first step is to eradicate any foreign invaders.
433 @@@ 0.0 @@@ The best approach is to pull them out by hand using a weeder or a hoe.
433 @@@ 0.0 @@@ This will also loosen the soil in affected areas.

433 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Culprits: Chinch bugs, gray-black, quarter-inch-long insects that suck moisture from grass and are most likely to attack St. Augustine and zoysia grasses in the South and Kentucky bluegrass in the North.
433 @@@ 0.0 @@@ To spot them, bury an empty coffee can, with both ends removed, at the edge of the affected area and fill it with water.
433 @@@ 0.0 @@@ The bugs will seek out the moisture, then float to the top.
433 @@@ 0.0 @@@ If you see more than 10 after 20 minutes, you should address the problem.
433 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Solutions: Chinch bugs live on the surface, among thatch, so dethatching will reduce their numbers.
433 @@@ 0.0 @@@ To eradicate them completely, look for an appropriate insecticide with a pyrethroid ingredient.

635 @@@ 5.0 @@@ -- Austrian investigators Monday released more details about the elaborate underground cellar where Josef Fritzl kept his daughter imprisoned for 24 years, along with three of their children.
635 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Josef Fritzl admitted to authorities he raped his daughter and fathered her children.
635 @@@ 4.0 @@@ Investigators believe Fritzl planned to build the cellar as early as 1978, shortly after, according to his daughter, he began raping her at age 11 or 12, said police spokesman Franz Polzer.
635 @@@ 2.0 @@@ The 73-year-old Austrian began building the dungeon as part of an addition to his home that year, and simply added the hidden space -- which was not recorded in any building plans -- Polzer said.
635 @@@ 1.0 @@@ It took Fritzl until 1983 to finish the addition, Polzer said.
635 @@@ 1.5 @@@ Investigators recently discovered another door to the dungeon prison, which was blocked by a 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) steel and concrete door that Fritzl probably stopped using when he later constructed an electronic door for a second entrance, Polzer said.
635 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Fritzl, who police believe was the only one with access to the cellar, had to travel through an elaborate maze to get to the prison. "
635 @@@ 1.0 @@@ You would have to open up a total of eight doors, and ... (for the) last door which would go into this space (where the family was imprisoned), you would also have to use electronic opening apparatus," Polzer said. "
635 @@@ 0.0 @@@ We will have to find out perhaps later from now if perhaps there are other spaces we haven't discovered yet, and perhaps maybe there is something else interesting."
635 @@@ 3.0 @@@ Fritzl was recently arrested and confessed to holding his daughter, Elisabeth, captive in the dungeon under the Fritzl home for decades, repeatedly raping her and fathering seven children -- six of whom survived.
635 @@@ 3.0 @@@ Three of the children were adopted by Josef Fritzl and his wife after he concocted the ruse that Elisabeth had left the babies on their doorstep.
635 @@@ 1.0 @@@ The story of the family's imprisonment began to unravel more than two weeks ago, when one of the children still in the dungeon, 19-year-old Kerstin Fritzl, fell seriously ill with convulsions.
635 @@@ 1.0 @@@ The father agreed to take her to a hospital, the first time she was allowed out of the prison where she had spent her entire life with her mother and two brothers.

635 @@@ 0.0 @@@ The health of the family members is satisfactory and hospital staff have been able to let more and more light into the rooms where the family is staying, Kepplinger said.
635 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Kepplinger said the children, after being confined to a small space their entire lives, are finding it increasingly easy to be in larger spaces.
635 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Initially the dungeon where Fritzl held his daughter was only 35 square meters.
635 @@@ 3.0 @@@ In 1993, around the time Elisabeth was pregnant with her fourth child, Fritzl decided to add to the dungeon, building another room that increased the entire living space of the family to about 55 square meters.

678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Unfortunately, nobody knows exactly when that was.
678 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Jack Daniel believed the more memorable his image, the more memorable his whiskey.
678 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Some records show that Jasper Newton "Jack" Daniel came into the world on September 5, 1846.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ His tombstone, however, says 1850.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Strange, because his mother died in 1847.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ All of this might not normally matter, but Jack's birth date is important to his overall legend, which proudly proclaims him "the boy distiller."
678 @@@ 2.0 @@@ So perhaps it's best we begin when Jack was first introduced to whiskey, which we know was early in life.
678 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Leaving home at a young age, Jack struck out on his own with nothing more than a handful of items valued at $9.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ He ended up at the home of Dan Call, a preacher at a nearby Lutheran church and the owner of a general store.

678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ In fact, many storytellers claim the boy wonder bought the still from Call and began pursuing the business full-time at the ripe age of 16.
678 @@@ 3.0 @@@ If that legend is true, then Jack began selling his own Tennessee whiskey only three years later; the famous black labels on the company bottles proudly pronounce, "Established and Registered in 1866."
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ In reality, no documents support that myth.
678 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Jack may have been a teenage moonshiner, but he didn't register his business with the federal government until 1875.
678 @@@ 1.0 @@@ And by then, Jack would have been the more booze-appropriate age of 29.
678 @@@ 1.0 @@@ The maker makes his mark Whatever legends exist, one thing is certain: Jack Daniel had a brilliant mind for marketing.
678 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Even as a youngster, Jack understood that if people remembered him, they would remember his whiskey.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ To that end, he decked himself out in a formal knee-length coat, a vest, a tie, and a wide-brim planter's hat, and was never caught out of "uniform" again.
678 @@@ 2.0 @@@ Jack also established the Jack Daniel's Silver Cornet Band -- a 10-member outfit solely devoted to promoting his whiskey across the countryside.
678 @@@ 2.0 @@@ With uniforms and instruments from the Sears & Roebuck catalog and a specially designed wagon for traveling, Jack made sure the band played every saloon opening, Fourth of July celebration, and political rally around.
678 @@@ 1.0 @@@ But perhaps Jack's most brilliant decision concerned how to present his whiskey.
678 @@@ 2.0 @@@ From the beginning, Jack had been one of the first sellers to stencil his distillery name on his whiskey jugs.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Next, he upgraded to round, custom-embossed bottles.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ But when a glass salesman showed him a prototype square bottle in 1895, Jack realized he'd stumbled upon something unique.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ The new bottles not only stood out from the crowd, but also had a shape that would prevent them from rolling around and breaking during transport.

678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Whatever effort Jack Daniel put into his marketing, he never let quality slip.

678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ The official historian at the Jack Daniel Distillery today says it's the most oft-asked question on factory tours.

678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ 7."
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ None of these stories, however, makes as much sense as the less-than-sexy explanation from Jack Daniel biographer Peter Krass.
678 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Simply put, Jack was originally assigned a district tax assessment number of 7.
678 @@@ 1.0 @@@ But when the IRS consolidated districts within Tennessee, they arbitrarily reassigned him the number 16.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Jack didn't want to confuse his loyal consumers, and he certainly didn't want to bend to the government, so he began labeling his bottles "Old No.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ 7."
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ More than 125 years later, this act of defiance still makes his labels stand out.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Jack without Jill Jack Daniel never married.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Some say it's because he was married to his work; others say it's because he never found a girl who measured up to his high standards.
678 @@@ 3.0 @@@ Or perhaps it's just that he was too busy catering to the greater Lynchburg population -- throwing elaborate Christmas feasts, hosting exquisite costume parties in his second-story ballroom, and donating money to every church in Moore County.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ But by all accounts, Jack was quite a ladies' man.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ He was a perfect dance partner, a polite conversationalist, and a fantastic gift-giver.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Unfortunately, he also gravitated toward girls young enough to be his daughter (or even granddaughter).
678 @@@ 2.0 @@@ Once, Jack even asked for a woman's hand in marriage, but her father denied him -- partly because Jack enjoyed keeping his own legend alive and always hesitated to reveal his true birth date.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ When Jack proposed, her father made it clear that any man unwilling to disclose his age was "a little too old for such a young girl."
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ The early bird gets the gangrene Hard as it might be to believe, in the end, the great distiller actually died from getting to work too early.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ As the story goes, one morning in 1906, Jack arrived at his office before anybody else.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ He tried to access the company safe, but had a terrible time remembering the code.

678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Then came gangrene, then amputation, and then, five years later, death.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ It's not the happiest ending for the story, or the clearest cut, but it is the best, because it adds to the mystery and mystique of Jack Daniel.
678 @@@ 0.0 @@@ As they say, where facts cannot be found, legends fill the empty space and that's perfectly fine for the keepers of the company flame.

708 @@@ 4.0 @@@ Croatia sent out a message of intent to the other Euro 2008 finalists as they stunned highly-fancied Germany 2-1 in Klagenfurt to secure a place in the quarterfinals.
708 @@@ 3.0 @@@ Ivicia Olic celebrates Croatia's second goal in their superb 2-1 victory over Germany.
708 @@@ 4.0 @@@ Darijo Srna and Ivica Olic struck the goals as Croatia, who had only ever beaten Germany once before, produced arguably the first major upset of the tournament.
708 @@@ 6.0 @@@ Lukas Podolski pulled a goal back late on for Germany with his third strike in two games to set up a nail-biting finale, but there was to be no way back for Joachim Loew's team, who finished with 10 men following the 90th-minute dismissal of substitute Bastian Schweinsteiger .
708 @@@ 2.0 @@@ Both sides came into the game having won their opening matches, although Germany had looked far more impressive in seeing off Poland than Croatia had in defeating Austria.
708 @@@ 3.0 @@@ However, it was Slaven Bilic's side who turned on the style at the Worthersee Stadion as they took control of Group B with two wins out of two.
708 @@@ 0.0 @@@ A frantic start to the match promised much but for all their huffing and puffing, neither side were able to create anything resembling a chance in the opening 20 minutes as defences held firm.
708 @@@ 2.0 @@@ The ball did find its way into the back of the net in the 22nd minute when Germany striker Mario Gomez slotted home past Stipe Pletikosa but the offside flag had already gone up against the Stuttgart man.
708 @@@ 2.0 @@@ The deadlock was broken for real just two minutes after that incident though, when Croatia went ahead through Srna.
708 @@@ 4.0 @@@ Danijel Pranjic sent over a superb cross from the left and Srna nipped in front of marker Marcell Jansen to slide the ball in at the far post, giving veteran Germany goalkeeper Jens Lehmann no chance.
708 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Croatia had a gilt-edged chance to make it 2-0 in the 30th minute, but Niko Kranjcar wasted it.
708 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Ivan Rakitic chipped a pass into the area which was flicked back towards the penalty spot by Olic, but the in-rushing Kranjcar was unable to cap a well-worked move as he blazed over.
708 @@@ 2.0 @@@ Germany knew they needed to step up through the gears and they finally made Pletikosa earn his keep with two efforts in rapid succession.
708 @@@ 4.0 @@@ The first saw Pletikosa push away a thunderous Michael Ballack free-kick, before the Spartak Moscow custodian awkwardly deflected away a Christoph Metzelder effort with his knee.
708 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Metzelder then headed a Torsten Frings corner just over from close range as the Germans stepped up their efforts for an equalizer before the break.
708 @@@ 5.0 @@@ However, Loew's side very nearly found themselves two goals behind in the 43rd minute, and they needed a fine reaction stop from Lehmann to deny Kranjcar, who chested down Olic's pass and smashed in a first-time volley.
708 @@@ 3.0 @@@ Having seen his side let off the hook, Loew opted for a more adventurous approach in the second half as he sacrificed full-back Jansen for jet-heeled winger David Odonkor during the interval.
708 @@@ 3.0 @@@ Aside from a Ballack shot over the crossbar though, Croatia looked fairly comfortable at the start of the period and also had a decent effort of their own with Luka Modric firing in a shot that Lehmann gathered, although not before seeing it squirm through his hands first.
708 @@@ 3.0 @@@ However, Lehmann's next task was to pick the ball out of the back of his net as Croatia stunned the Germans with a second goal in the 62nd minute.
708 @@@ 4.0 @@@ A Rakitic cross from the right took a deflection off Podolski before arrowing goalwards and although Lehmann, who had begun to come out for the initial cross, managed to dive backwards and get a hand on it, the ball struck his near post before rebounding back out to Olic, who had the easy task of slotting home.
708 @@@ 2.0 @@@ Germany looked for an immediate response but aside from a Schweinsteiger shot that fizzed across the face of goal, they were still finding it difficult to create chances against a well-organised Croatia backline.
708 @@@ 3.0 @@@ Loew's side earned themselves a lifeline with 12 minutes to go though when Podolski lashed home a shot on the half-volley after the ball had fallen kindly to him in the box.
708 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Germany could not build on that goal, though, and their final hopes of getting anything out of the match all but disappeared when Schweinsteiger was given a straight red card for shoving Jerko Leko in the final minute of an absorbing encounter. "
708 @@@ 0.0 @@@ I want to especially congratulate my players, not only for the fight they showed but for playing an excellent match," said a delighted Bilic. "
708 @@@ 0.0 @@@ There is no other way to beat the Germans than to play well.
708 @@@ 0.0 @@@ They're still a great team, though, and still one of the favorites for the title."

745 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Toobin: Justice Kennedy made precisely that point in the opinion.
745 @@@ 0.0 @@@ He said, allowing the death penalty here would create a perverse incentive for child rapists to murder their victims.

970 @@@ 3.0 @@@ (AOL Autos) -- There is an old adage which goes something like this: "The cheap man always pays more in the long run."
970 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Consumer Reports analyzed the cost of ownership across the 300 models in their database.
970 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Consumer Reports magazine recently reached a similar conclusion when it announced the results of a study that compared the cost of ownership of more than 300 cars.
970 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Consumer Reports noted that a car with a cheaper sticker price can often cost consumers more in the long run when compared to a higher-priced alternative.
970 @@@ 1.0 @@@ The report, which appeared in Consumer Reports' Annual April Auto Issue, was based on a comparison of the 300 models in the Consumer Reports database.
970 @@@ 1.0 @@@ In short, the report concluded that a car's sticker price is one of many factors that should be taken into account when trying to decide between two cars in the same class.
970 @@@ 1.0 @@@ For example, at about $17,500, a Mitsubishi Lancer is priced $5,000 less than a Mini Cooper.
970 @@@ 1.0 @@@ But when factoring in the total costs of ownership for each vehicle, the Lancer could cost drivers about $3,000 more to own over the first five years, according to the study.
970 @@@ 1.3333333333333333 @@@ And the purchase price of a Toyota Highlander is about $3,000 more than a V6 Ford Explorer -- but the Explorer's total cost of ownership is an extra $6,500 over those five years.
970 @@@ 0.0 @@@ The study took into account such factors as depreciation, fuel costs, interest paid on the car loan, insurance, maintenance, repair costs and sales tax.
970 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Online subscribers to www.
970 @@@ 1.0 @@@ ConsumerReports.org can compare the costs for one, three, five and eight years of ownership. "
970 @@@ 0.0 @@@ We think this information is valuable for consumers who have shopped around, and settled on a couple of different cars they like, and then have to decide on one or the other," noted Cliff Weathers, Consumer Reports' deputy editor, autos. "

970 @@@ 1.0 @@@ And in this particular case, the answer would be the Miata -- which was one of the least expensive cars to own of all the cars evaluated in our survey."
970 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Depreciation was factored into the estimates based on the assumption that the vehicle will eventually be traded in when buyers make their next car purchase. "
970 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Depreciation is the factor that accounts for the highest cost of ownership," Weathers explained. "
970 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Depreciation accounts for 48 percent of the cost of ownership over the first five years."
970 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Different models depreciate faster, and more significantly, than others.
970 @@@ 1.0 @@@ In order to calculate depreciation for this owner-cost comparison, Consumer Reports started with the price that a typically-equipped model generally sells for.
970 @@@ 0.0 @@@ If a particular model often sells at a largely-discounted price that was also factored in.
970 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Consumer Reports then deducted the wholesale trade-in value of the car at the end of the period, based on data from their Used Car Price Service, Weathers explained.
970 @@@ 1.0 @@@ In those cases when Consumer Reports didn't have depreciation data for a new model, it used estimates based on comparable vehicles.
970 @@@ 2.0 @@@ The Fuel Factor The second-biggest factor in cost-of-ownership, after depreciation, is fuel costs, which account for 21 percent of the total ownership costs. "
970 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Fuel economy can really make a big difference," Weathers said. "
970 @@@ 3.0 @@@ If you have a car that gets 25 miles per gallon, and another car that gets 19 miles per gallon, that's a potential difference of thousands of dollars over five years, if you're driving 12,000 miles a year."
970 @@@ 2.0 @@@ Consumer Reports calculated fuel costs by assuming that the vehicles would be driven 12,000 miles a year -- the average annual mileage reported by those who responded to Consumer Reports' annual reader survey.
970 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Consumer Reports then applied the national average price of regular gas as of December 2007 or, if applicable, the price of premium or diesel fuel.
970 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Fuel costs were an especially big factor with SUVs, the comparison revealed.
970 @@@ 2.0 @@@ Drivers who buy a Dodge Nitro could pay more than $10,000 to fill up the tank over a five-year period, for example.
970 @@@ 2.0 @@@ But the fuel costs for a similar-sized, more fuel-efficient Toyota RAV4 V6 would be $2,000 less during that period.
970 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Consumer Reports' comparison also concluded that interest paid on car loans accounts for about 12 percent of five-year ownership costs.
970 @@@ 2.0 @@@ That figure is based on a five-year loan, with a 15 percent down payment, using the average interest rate of 6.86 percent reported by Bankrate.com in December 2007.
970 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Auto insurance accounts for about 11 percent of total ownership costs over five years, according to the Consumer Reports comparison.
970 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Car insurance costs can vary depending on several factors such as the driver's age, location, and driving record.
970 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Auto insurance costs, in some cases, dramatically boosted the ownership costs of models that otherwise boasted reasonable ownership costs.
970 @@@ 1.0 @@@ As an example, Weathers compared the difference in auto insurance rates for Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution and a similarly-priced Acura TL. "
970 @@@ 2.0 @@@ Insurance for the Lancer can cost you $2,500 a year or more, based our 2007 figures," notes Weathers. "
970 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Meanwhile, the annual car insurance rates for the Acura TL can cost as little as $900."
970 @@@ 2.0 @@@ Maintenance & Repairs Surprisingly, maintenance and car repairs account for only four percent of the cost of ownership, Weathers said.
970 @@@ 2.0 @@@ The maintenance and repair cost figures used in Consumer Reports' cost of ownership comparison were based on information gleaned from more than a million respondents in its annual Car Reliability Survey.
970 @@@ 2.0 @@@ One notable conclusion reached in the Consumer Reports study is that Lexus models have relatively high maintenance and repair costs -- primarily due to maintenance alone, even though Lexus owners reported excellent reliability.
970 @@@ 2.0 @@@ The Lexus ES350 racks up an average of $2,300 in maintenance and repair in the first five years.
970 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Meanwhile, owners of a comparable Lincoln MKZ can expect to pay only half that much.
970 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Another interesting tidbit discovered in the comparison is that the Range Rover is the most expensive vehicle on average for five and eight years when it comes to maintenance and repairs, costing about $2,000 in the fifth year alone.
970 @@@ 2.0 @@@ Meanwhile, the comparable Toyota Land Cruiser costs only $600 in that year to maintain and repair.
970 @@@ 0.0 @@@ Some might be surprised to hear that the sales tax on the purchase price of the vehicle accounts for as much of the cost of ownership as maintenance and repairs.
970 @@@ 1.0 @@@ For its study, Consumer Reports used the national average of 4.83 percent in 2007.
970 @@@ 2.0 @@@ With hybrid cars being a hot topic in the auto industry, Consumer Reports was also interested in the cost of owning one of those fuel-sipping vehicles.
970 @@@ 1.0 @@@ The report concluded that Toyota Prius hybrid actually costs less to own than similar conventional models.
970 @@@ 1.6666666666666665 @@@ Specifically, the sale price of a Prius is about $7,500 higher than a similarly-sized Chevrolet Cobalt, but the total cost of ownership over five years is almost $2,000 less - due primarily to its much lower fuel costs, although the amount of depreciation was a factor as well.
970 @@@ 1.0 @@@ Weathers pointed to another interesting finding: "There are some vehicles, namely BMW, that are very inexpensive to own over first five years, because all of the maintenance is paid for during that period, under the warranty," he says. "
970 @@@ 1.0 @@@ But if we take it forward, the cost of maintenance and repairs over the next three years after that is going to be more expensive."
